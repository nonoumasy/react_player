      [00:08.30]I'm going down to the place tonight
[00:12.00]To see if I can get a taste tonight
[00:16.30]A taste of something warm and sweet
[00:21.00]That shivers your bones and rises to your heat
[00:25.00]I'm going down to the place tonight
[00:29.00]The damp and hungry place tonight
[00:33.00]Should all the stars shine in the sky
[00:38.00]They couldn't outshine your sparkling eyes
[00:42.00]But it's so hard to be the one
[00:46.00]To touch and tease and to do it all for fun
[00:50.30]But it's too much for a young heart to take
[00:54.00]Cause hearts are the easiest things you could break
[00:59.00]And I talk to the filth and I walk to the door
[01:03.00]I'm knee deep in myself
[01:06.00]But I want to get more of that stuff
[01:11.00]Of that stuff
[01:15.00]Some candy talking
[01:24.00]Talk
[01:40.00]And I want
[01:44.00]And I want
[01:49.00]Some candy talking
[02:05.00]Some candy talk
[02:22.00]I love the way she's walking
[02:26.00]I love the way she's talking
[02:30.00]It's just the way she's walking
[02:35.00]It's just the way she's talking
[02:40.00]And I need
[02:41.00]All that stuff
[02:44.00]Give me some
[02:46.00]Of that stuff
[02:48.00]I want your candy. I want your candy
[02:54.00]And I need
[02:55.00]Give me some
[02:57.00]Of your stuff
[02:59.00]Give me some
[03:01.00]I want your candy. I want your candy.
[03:05.00]I want your candy. I want your candy.
[03:10.00]I want stuff
