      [00:08.30]I'm going down to the place tonight
[00:12.00]To see if I can get a taste tonight
[00:16.30]A taste of something warm and sweet
[00:21.00]That shivers your bones and rises to your heat
[00:25.00]I'm going down to the place tonight
[00:29.00]The damp and hungry place tonight
[00:33.00]Should all the stars shine in the sky
[00:38.00]They couldn't outshine your sparkling eyes
[00:42.00]But it's so hard to be the one
[00:46.00]To touch and tease and to do it all for fun
[00:50.30]But it's too much for a young heart to take
[00:54.00]Cause hearts are the easiest things you could break
[00:59.00]And I talk to the filth and I walk to the door
[01:03.00]I'm knee deep in myself
[01:06.00]But I want to get more of that stuff
[01:11.00]Of that stuff
[01:15.00]Some candy talking
[01:24.00]Talk
[01:40.00]And I want
[01:44.00]And I want
[01:49.00]Some candy talking
[02:05.00]Some candy talk
[02:22.00]I love the way she's walking
[02:26.00]I love the way she's talking
[02:30.00]It's just the way she's walking
[02:35.00]It's just the way she's talking
[02:40.00]And I need
[02:41.00]All that stuff
[02:44.00]Give me some
[02:46.00]Of that stuff
[02:48.00]I want your candy. I want your candy
[02:54.00]And I need
[02:55.00]Give me some
[02:57.00]Of your stuff
[02:59.00]Give me some
[03:01.00]I want your candy. I want your candy.
[03:05.00]I want your candy. I want your candy.
[03:10.00]I want stuff

      The sun comes up another day begins
And I don't even worry about the state I'm in
Head so heavy and I'm looking thin
But when the sun goes down I want to start again
You never understandin'
You never understand me
Yeah

Don't turn around until you look at me
Why don't you take a second and tell me what you see
Things I see you only disagree
You never understand that's what I want to be
You never understandin'
You never understand me
Yeah

Not wishing to hide but you just can't see me
I tell you the truth but you don't believe me
Thinking of love but I can't hear what you're saying
Tomorrow I'm leaving
Cause I'm not understanding you

I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you

I have run
I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls
Only to be with you

But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in her fingertips
It burned like fire
This burning desire

I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone

But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for

I believe in the kingdom come
Then all the colors will bleed into one
Bleed into one
Well yes I'm still running

You broke the bonds and you
Loosed the chains
Carried the cross
Of my shame
Of my shame
You know I believed it

But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for...

      When routine bites hard,
And ambitions are low,
And resentment rides high,
But emotions won't grow,
And we're changing our ways,
Taking different roads.

Then love, love will tear us apart again.
Love, love will tear us apart again.

Why is the bedroom so cold?
You've turned away on your side.
Is my timing that flawed?
Our respect runs so dry.
Yet there's still this appeal
That we've kept through our lives.

But love, love will tear us apart again.
Love, love will tear us apart again.

You cry out in your sleep,
All my failings exposed.
And there's a taste in my mouth,
As desperation takes hold.
Just that something so good
Just can't function no more.

But love, love will tear us apart again.
Love, love will tear us apart again.
Love, love will tear us apart again.
Love, love will tear us apart again.
